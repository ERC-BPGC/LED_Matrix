**INTRODUCTION**
  
Diving into the world of retro pixelated games is a nostalgic journey! Recreating those classic games, LED array is an incredible project. Picture this: a dynamic display composed of LEDs, each representing a pixel, meticulously controlled by your code. 
Hosting 1v1 playoffs on this platform could be a blast. Players could compete head-to-head, strategizing and manoeuvring through the LED maze, creating an electrifying atmosphere as they vie for victory.

The goal of this project is to make a working Led Matrix and use it for playing arcade games designed in house.
